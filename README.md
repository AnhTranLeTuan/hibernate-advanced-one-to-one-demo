# Hibernate advanced: One-to-one Relationship

## Description
Experiment with concepts of Hibernate, ORM (Objectâ€“relational mapping), and one-to-one mapping. In this project, we can see how:
* Configure Hibernate in the XML file (/hibernate-advanced-one-to-one-demo/src/hibernate.cfg.xml)
* Create entities in which Java classes or their objects will be mapped to the database's table (entity/...)
* Establish one-to-one mapping between entities
* Map objects to tables of MySQL (demo/...)
* Test the unidirectional relationship between two entities
* Test the bidirectional relationship between two entities
